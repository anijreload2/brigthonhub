1. **Create DetailsTab component** for centralized detail management
2. **Enhance existing tabs** with new field management
3. **Create media upload system**
4. **Add review moderation interface**

### Phase 3: API Enhancement (HIGH PRIORITY)
1. **Update existing API routes** to handle new fields
2. **Create review APIs** for CRUD operations
3. **Add media management APIs**
4. **Implement SEO metadata APIs**

### Phase 4: Detail Page Components (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

2. **Create food item detail page** with ordering system
3. **Create project detail page** with gallery
4. **Create blog detail page** with rich content
5. **Create store product detail page** with e-commerce features

### Phase 5: Testing & Optimization (LOW PRIORITY)

## NEXT IMMEDIATE ACTIONS

1. ✅ **Migration SQL is ready** - Admin needs to run it in Supabase
2. 🔄 **Update API routes** to handle new fields
3. 🔄 **Create enhanced admin interface** for detail management
4. 🔄 **Build detail page components** with new functionality
5. 🔄 **Test end-to-end workflow** from admin to public pages

The migration SQL is comprehensive and ready to execute. The main gaps are in the admin interface and actual detail page components, which should be built after the database migration is completed.
