# Cart and Payment Functionality Removal

## Overview
As part of the platform transformation, cart and payment functionality has been temporarily disabled across all product pages. The site now focuses on connecting buyers with sellers directly through contact information.

## Changes Made

### Food Page (`app/food/page.tsx`)
- âœ… Commented out cart state management
- âœ… Commented out cart functions (addToCart, removeFromCart, getCartTotal, getTotalItems)
- âœ… Commented out cart UI components (cart summary, quantity selectors, "Add to Cart" buttons)
- âœ… Updated main CTA to "View Details & Contact Seller"

### Store Page (`app/store/page.tsx`)
- âœ… Commented out cart state management
- âœ… Commented out cart functions (addToCart, removeFromCart, getTotalItems)
- âœ… Commented out cart UI components (cart button, quantity selectors, "Add to Cart" buttons)
- âœ… Updated main CTA to "View Details & Contact Seller"

### Detail Pages
- âœ… Food detail page: Commented out handleAddToCart function
- âœ… Store detail page: Already clean of cart functionality

## Current User Flow
1. **Browse Products**: Users can search, filter, and browse all products
2. **View Details**: Click "View Details & Contact Seller" to see full product information
3. **Contact Seller**: Use seller contact information (phone, email, address) to inquire about products
4. **Direct Communication**: All transactions happen directly between buyer and seller

## Next Steps
1. âœ… Push changes to GitHub
2. ðŸ”„ Implement comprehensive user platform system:
   - Admin controls for user approval/registration
   - Vendor dashboard with product management
   - User messaging system
   - Role-based access control

## Security Note
Sellers can choose which contact information to display (address, email, phone, social media) for their products, ensuring privacy and security control.
